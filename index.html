              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>
                We truly believe that the dog is a man's best friend. Therefore,
                we want to offer you the opportunity to rent a dog for your
                specific purpose. Rent a Friend works with a number of certified
                and specialized trainers, and can help you or your company with
                your specific need.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                We often work with retired police dogs who are no longer active
                officers but still know how to work the snout, and support dogs
                who love to say hi at the elder homes, hospitals and day cares.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                We also have a partnership with
                <a class="text-link" href="https://hundstallet.se/"
                  >Hundstallet</a
                >
                who helps us find a friend for those who need some extra
                company. Many elders have contacted us during Covid-19 in order
                to get some company during these lonely times.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Donâ€™t forget! If you already have a furry friend you can enter
                your dog and yourself in any of our classes.
